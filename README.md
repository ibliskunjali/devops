This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps". 

The project started on the 1st January 2022 to  March 31st 2022, which happens to be exactly 90 Days.

As we are now into 2023 you can see we have continued the effort and the learning in public for a new 90 Days where this one has a focus around security and namely DevSecOps. 

The reason for documenting this is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

The goal is to take 90 days, 1 hour each a day, to tackle over 13 areas of "DevOps" to a foundational knowledge.

This will **not cover all things** "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall. The project began as a public way to share my notes and learning exercises and since then has had some great exposure to the community.
